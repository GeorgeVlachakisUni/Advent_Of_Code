# Advent of Code Repository 

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository.  
## What is Advent of Code?  

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, from December 1st to December 25th, a new coding puzzle is released. Participants are challenged to solve these puzzles using their programming skills.  
## Motivation  

The primary motivation behind this repository is to learn, and improve my Python programming skills. 
## Structure  

The repository is organized by years, and each year contains folders for individual days. Each day's folder includes the problem description and my Python solutions.
